Performance Report

- Note that I changed my CUDA & CPU algorithm to fix the different solution
  issue. But it seems that the change caused performance degradation in both
  C and CUDA.

- Ratio of wall : the performance enhancement degree is increased proportional
                  to the ratio of non-wall pixels, because it increases the
                  parallel-ability of calculation.
